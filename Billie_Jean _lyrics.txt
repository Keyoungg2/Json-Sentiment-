Paroles de la chanson Billie Jean par Michael Jackson
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene

I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one

Who will dance on the floor in the round ?

She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round



She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene

Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one

Who will dance on the floor,

In the round



People always told me be careful of what you do


Don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts

And mother always told me be careful of who you love

Be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth



[Refrain] :

Billie Jean is not my lover

She's just a girl who claims that I am the one

But the kid is not my son

She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son



For forty days and forty nights

The law was on her side

But who can stand when she's in demand

Her schemes and her plans

'Cause we danced on the floor in the round

So take my strong advice,


Just remember to always think twice

(Do think twice, do think twice)



She told my baby we danced till three,

And she looked at me,

Then showed a photo my baby cried

His eyes were like mine

Can we dance on the floor in the round, baby



People always told me be careful of what you do

Don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts

But she came and stood right by me then the smell of sweet perfume

This happened much too soon she called me to her room



[Refrain]

Billie Jean is not my lover


She's just a girl who claims that I am the one

But the kid is not my son

No no no ...

Billie Jean is not my lover

She's just a girl who claims that I am the one

But the kid is not my son



She says I am the one

But the kid is not my son



She says I am the one

But the kid is not my son



Billie Jean is not my lover

She's just a girl who claims that I am the one

But the kid is not my son



She says I am the one


But the kid is not my soon



She says I am the one

You know, you did

She says he is my son

breakin' my heart, baby

She says I am the one



Billie Jean is not my lover

Billie Jean is not my lover

Billie Jean is not my lover

Billie Jean is not my lover

Billie Jean is not my lover

Billie Jean is not my lover
